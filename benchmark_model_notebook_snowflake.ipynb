In addition to accurate predictions, the model should also identify and emphasize the key factors that significantly influence water quality.\n\nParticipants will be provided with a dataset containing three water quality parameters — **Total Alkalinity**, **Electrical Conductance**, and **Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus** — collected between 2011 and 2015 from approximately 200 river locations across South Africa. Each data point includes the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the sampling site, the date of collection, and the corresponding water quality measurements.\n\nUsing this dataset, participants are expected to build a machine learning model to predict water quality parameters for a separate validation dataset, which includes locations from different regions not present in the training data. The challenge also encourages participants to explore feature importance and provide insights into the factors most strongly associated with variations in water quality.\n\nThis challenge is designed for participants with varying levels of experience in data science, remote sensing, and environmental analytics. It offers a valuable opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world environmental data and contribute to advancing water quality monitoring using artificial intelligence."

The model has been developed to predict **water quality parameters** using features derived from the **Landsat** and **TerraClimate** datasets. Specifically, four spectral bands — **SWIR22** (Shortwave Infrared 2), **NIR** (Near Infrared), **Green**, and **SWIR16** (Shortwave Infrared 1) — were utilized from Landsat, along with derived spectral indices such as **NDMI** (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and **MNDWI** (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index). In addition, the **PET** (Potential Evapotranspiration) variable was incorporated from the **TerraClimate** dataset to account for climatic influences on water quality.\n\nThe dataset spans a five-year period from **2011 to 2015**. Using **API-based data extraction** methods, both Landsat and TerraClimate features were retrieved directly from the [Microsoft Planetary Computer portal](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com).\n\nThese combined spectral, index-based, and climatic features were used as predictors in a regression model to estimate three key water quality parameters: **Total Alkalinity (TA)**, **Electrical Conductance (EC)**, and **Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP)**.\n\nPlease note that this notebook serves only as a starting point. Several assumptions were made during the data extraction and model development process, which you may find opportunities to improve upon. Participants are encouraged to explore additional features, enhance preprocessing techniques, or experiment with different regression algorithms to optimize predictive performance."

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to **load previously extracted satellite and climate data** from separate files, rather than performing the extraction directly, which allows for a smoother and faster experience. Participants can refer to the dedicated extraction notebooks—one for Landsat and another for TerraClimate—to understand how the data was retrieved and processed, and they can also generate their own output CSV files if needed. Using these pre-extracted CSV files, this notebook focuses on loading the predictor features and running the subsequent analysis and model training efficiently.\n\nFor more detailed guidance on the original data extraction process, you can review the Landsat and TerraClimate example notebooks available on the Planetary Computer portal:\n\n- [Landsat-c2-l2 - Example-Notebook](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2#Example-Notebook)  \n- [Terraclimate - Example-Notebook](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/terraclimate#Example-Notebook)\n\nWe have used selected spectral bands — **SWIR22** (Shortwave Infrared 2), **NIR** (Near Infrared), **Green**, and **SWIR16** (Shortwave Infrared 1) — and computed key spectral indices such as **NDMI** (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and **MNDWI** (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index). These features capture surface moisture, vegetation, and water content characteristics that influence water quality variability.\n\nIn addition to Landsat features, we also incorporated the **Potential Evapotranspiration (PET)** variable from the **TerraClimate** dataset, which provides high-resolution global climate data. The PET feature captures the atmospheric demand for moisture, representing climatic conditions such as temperature, humidity, and radiation that influence surface water evaporation and thus affect water quality parameters.\n\nThe predictor features include:\n\n- **SWIR22** – Sensitive to surface moisture and turbidity variations in water bodies.  \n- **NIR** – Helps in identifying vegetation and suspended matter in water.  \n- **Green** – Useful for detecting water color and surface reflectance changes.  \n- **SWIR16** – Provides information on surface dryness and sediment concentration.  \n- **NDMI** – Derived from NIR and SWIR16, indicates moisture and vegetation–water interaction.  \n- **MNDWI** – Derived from Green and SWIR22, effective for distinguishing open water areas and reducing built-up noise.  \n- **PET** – Extracted from the TerraClimate dataset, represents potential evapotranspiration influencing hydrological and water quality dynamics."

This **prevents data leakage** because the scaler is fitted only on the training data of each fold during cross-validation, never seeing the validation data.\n\n### GroupKFold by Location\nInstead of a simple random split, we use **GroupKFold** grouping by geographic location (combination of Latitude and Longitude). This ensures that **all samples from the same monitoring station stay in the same fold**, simulating real spatial evaluation — the model is evaluated on locations it has never seen during training.\n\nThe locations (Latitude, Longitude) are used only to define the fold splits during GroupKFold — they are not used as input features to the model.\n\nSo, the groups parameter tells GroupKFold which rows belong together (same station), but the model itself only ever sees swir22, NDMI, MNDWI, and pet. The groups ensure that during hyperparameter tuning, no fold leaks data from a station it's supposed to evaluate on — but the trained model has no knowledge of coordinates.\n\nAt final prediction time, pipeline_TA.predict(submission_val_data) receives only ['swir22', 'NDMI', 'MNDWI', 'pet'] — no location information at all.\n\n### RandomizedSearchCV for Hyperparameter Tuning\nWe use `RandomizedSearchCV` to efficiently search for the best XGBoost hyperparameters by sampling random combinations from the search space. This is faster than an exhaustive `GridSearchCV` and generally finds good configurations with fewer iterations.\n\n### Model Evaluation\nAfter tuning, we evaluate the best model found using:\n- **R² Score**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the observed values.\n- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Quantifies the average magnitude of prediction errors."
